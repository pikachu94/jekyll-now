## What did you do this past week?
This past week I dedicated myself to study for my two exams this week, software engineering and computer networks.  Since this is the first midterm I feel there has been a lot of material covered. I have gone over all the functions we have seen so far and implement them the best way I can. In class we have gone through iterators and decorators which it's still a bit confusing to me. 

## What's in your way?
I have not being able to focus on most of my classes, which has become a little bit difficult and sometimes I have to read twice to catch up. Also, trying to schedule interviews while on classes it's a little overwhelming. 


## What will you do next week?
 I started working on my cheat sheet over the weekend. I still have to finish a big assignment for my other class today. Today I will review one more time from the very beginning everything we have covered in class and attempt to get 7 hours of sleep every day to function well. I believe think the best way to prepare for this test will be to  work with some of the functions and classes we've discussed in class, and then mess around with them. I have been playing around with the  Python  all this weekend.



## Tip of the week:
The class notes on Canvas are very helpful. They cover the material that was discussed in lecture. Maybe give it a look today before the exam if you haven't.
