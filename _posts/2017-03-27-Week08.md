## Week 08


Last week was way crazy, I had to worry about interviews and projects. I'm really happy with the topic my group and I chose because the API was easy to find and we went straight to building the website. 
I'm part of the front-end group. I've been trying to get a taste of javascript and html. 

This week in class we went over different functions in python such as project, theta cross join, cross join and natural join. The three last ones have a target of joining two sets. They differ on the goal of each for example theta joins two sets under the condition of the binary operator.
 
My goals for this week is to prepare ahead for the upcoming project. I also have to start prepating for my computer networks exam happening this week. Along with that is keeping up with the rest of the classes since graduations is happenign in less than 50 days. This semester feels like its going way too fast sometimes I can't even catch a breath. 

### Tip of the week:

Here is an interesting article about simplicity in code and the many benefits from it. 
"The fact of the matter is that code is a liability. You and your teammates are responsible for each and every line of code you produce" as Mathias Lafeldt argues.
