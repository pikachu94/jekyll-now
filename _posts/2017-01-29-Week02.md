## Week 02


## 1. What did you do this past week?
This past week consisted in putting all assignments and tests into my agenda. 
I'm stil learning how to time management. My classes are project based so I need to distribute enoguh time for each. There is also a lot of reading involved in all of the classes. I'm not the biggest fan of reading but it is the best way to expand knowledge. 

## 2. What's in your way?
My one and only obstacle is exhaustion. I did not start on the right foot but I'm hoping for the weekend to lay down everything  I need to do for the upcoming week so I can work in advance.


## 3. What will you do next week?
Next week I will attend all my classes and limit my cell phone use in order to pay full attention. I will also try to start homework the same day they are assigned.

## Tip of the week:
Finding your people.
Soemtimes working with company can be a good thing as long as they are not distracting you. Since all projects are being assigned with pair programming, it's important to find someone who can help you and you can help them, where both improve daily and learn from each other.
