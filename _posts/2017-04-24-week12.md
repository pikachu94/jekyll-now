## Week 12
## What did you do this past week?
It was all about dealing with the last part of the project and start to wrap up the semester assignments for all my other classes. We also implemented the group’s api by generating a games wishlist according to the user's selection of theme and rating. 
Also, thinking about last minute fixes for the website. I think my team did a pretty good job and we were able to submit the  project on time. It was fun to work on the front-end part and see how the full stack development interconnects itself. 

## What will you do next week?
There's only two week of classes left, therefore I have to start preparing for finals since everything goes down the last week of class. We are also doing the extra credit portion of the subprocesses of python and how to implement them. Then we have the website's presentation plus. 

## Class:
We did in fact go over a lot into refactoring. We are going from a Store simulator written in java to understand this process of making a big function and breaking it into simple functions to make it more simple without overriding the program’s importance.


## Tip of the week:
