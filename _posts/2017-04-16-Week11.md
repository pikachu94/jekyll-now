## What did you do this past week?
I tried to keep up with my homeworks and meetings but I feel like a day with 24 hours it's just not enough. It's three more weeks until graduation and everything is piling up very quickly, there's 4 exams, 1 homeworks and 2 projects left to call it a degree! #yay

## What's in your way?
Like always, organizing all my tasks and accomplishing in time. I have to keep up with readings for all my classes too since I have fall behind in those. Hopefully by now I can catch up in the Refactoring readings.

## What will you do next week?
We have to work on the last part of our project which includes implementing search and improving design. We also have to find a useful way to use other group's API. 

We finished reviewing how to query with SQL efficiently. I have had previous knowledge with MySQL but it was nice to review and learn how to deal with data more precisely. We have now finished  refactoring and started on some java programming where we went through Method Overriding and its' efficiency.
