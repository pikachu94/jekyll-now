## week 7


Last week I had tests with projects and hws due. 
It was definately a rough week trying to manage it all. 


## What did you do this past week?
I tried to stay on top of the game with everything that was due, but it was certainly hard to distribute time with all the courses I'm taking. We had our first test last week of Software Engineering, some people advice me on what to prepare for, hopefully it went well.

## What's in your way?
I'm looking forward to pick it up from this first round of midterms I have had. I think after this first midterms I have a pretty good sense of why the next midterms will be and prepare better.


## What will you do next week?
I need to find a group for this next project. I'm excited to start. I also have  to organize myself with all the other homeworks and projects for the other classes. I want to learn more about front-end development, and I know this project will help me achieve that. I plan to set up time to actually read before class because I still have not gotten that down. 


## Tip of the week:
Interesting read on web development:
Dismantling the Barriers to Entry
