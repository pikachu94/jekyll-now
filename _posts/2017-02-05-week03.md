## Week 3




This week was a bit hectic since I just got added to a class where I had to catch up with the rest of the students. It's crazy how much you can get behind in one week. I'm still struggling on how to time manage all the computer science classes assigned this semester in order for me to graduate. I got behind in the first project which I'm still trying to finish. 
I need to set time apart for all my classes and not get distracted. I'm going to close my social media pages in order to focus more.


There are many obstacles such as reviewing python since I have not coded in this language for years, as well as trying to solve programming issues at the same time. 

Next week, I'm going to start the project earlier in order to go to office hours in time. I have not been doing well in quizzes either because it's been hard keeping up with all the readings. Starting today I will finish all readings on time so I can be fully prepared to tackle this class the best way possible. I also will review python problems on the side to make programming a bit easier.




## Tip-of the week:
Houston, we have an opportunity!
This phrase is often used as to explain we have a problem : "Houston, we have a problem!".
However, I hope we can take all problems to a chance of finding an opportunity to fix things, to make them better. It's a chance to challenge oneself to succeed and get better.
