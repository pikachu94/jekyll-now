## Week 13

## What did you do this past week?
This past week I had assignments due for my literature class. I also had my IDB presentation along with the extra credit. I have three more essays to write for my literatire class and I will be done.

## What will you do next week?
Next week is my last week as an undergrad student, where I have two exams. One of them is on thursday for my SWE class, the other one is for my computer networks class and it's on Friday. I'm more worried about SWE because  I didn't do that well on the previous midterm so I'll emphasize my study time into it. I'm still figuring out the best way to tackle all the information given since it's a lot of material to cover.

## Class:
Last week we dedicated time for all the groups to present their extra credit presentation along with the websites as well. It's really nice to see the different dynamics of each group. My favorite website was [http://gamelookup.me](http://gamelookup.me), their design was simple yet it went with their theme and everything. 
I want to learn how to better work with CSS and bootstrap to get well-designed websites!


## Tip of the week:
"Study smarter, not harder"
